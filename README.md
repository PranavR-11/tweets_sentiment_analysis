# Tweets Sentiment Analysis
This notebook performs a comprehensive sentiment analysis pipeline on textual data. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and extract meaningful insights from the data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
The steps include:

ðŸ§© Project Flow
	1.	Data Handling
Import and explore the dataset to understand its structure.
	2.	Text Cleaning & Preprocessing
	â€¢	Regular Expressions (RegEx): Clean and analyze text patterns.
	â€¢	Hashtag Extraction: Identify and analyze hashtags.
	â€¢	Emoji Analysis: Detect and interpret emojis in text.
	â€¢	Lemmatization: Normalize words to their base forms.
	â€¢	Language Detection: Identify the language of each text snippet.
	â€¢	Sarcasm Detection (via RegEx): Attempt to spot sarcastic patterns.
	3.	Hashtag Analysis
Dive deeper into hashtags to understand popular topics and trends.
	4.	Pipeline Creation
Build an end-to-end pipeline that automates the preprocessing steps.
	5.	Sentiment Analysis
Apply sentiment analysis models to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
	6.	Visualization
Visualize the results to better understand sentiment distributions and key insights.
